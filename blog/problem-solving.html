        <h2>Blocked on a Simple Problem</h2>
        <p>
          I got stuck on what looked like a really small problem (looping
          through an array to build a gradebook object) I kept trying things
          like <code>gradebook.students</code> or
          <code>gradebook[students]</code>, thinking it made sense, but it never
          worked.
        </p>
        <p>
          To get through it, I slowed down and tried to break down the
          instructions into something that I could comprehend and would
          <em>'click'</em>. Then I used <code>console.log</code> to check each
          step and even talked it out to myself (rubber ducky method).
        </p>
        <p>
          At the time I felt frustrated and lost. I couldn't comprehend the
          instructions. I learned was to slow down, break the problem into
          smaller steps, and trust the process.

        <h2>Elegantly Solved a Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Another task was to calculate an average. Instead of overcomplicating
          it, I just thought, add the numbers together and divide by how many
          there are. I wrote a simple loop and it worked first try.
        </p>
        <p>
          It felt good to get something right in such a clean way. I learned
          that not every problem needs a clever or complex solution, sometimes
          the simplest approach is the best.

        <h2>Confidence with Problem-Solving Techniques</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Pseudocode</strong> - Helpful when I take the time, but I
            don't always remember to do it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Trying something</strong> - I do this often, but I need to
            reflect more so I don't keep looping back over the same mistakes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Rubber ducky method</strong> - Works better than I expected,
            saying things out loud often shows me mistakes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reading error messages</strong> - I'm building confidence
            here. They usually tell me the answer if I actually read them
            properly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Console.logging</strong> - My go-to tool. It helps me see
            what's really happening in my code.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Googling</strong> - I'm confident, but learning to be more
            specific with my search terms (like “JavaScript object key by
            variable” instead of just “JavaScript help lol”).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Asking peers for help</strong> - I never really ask my peers
            for help, I like cracking problems on my own, even if it takes
            longer. It is something I know I need to get better at.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Asking coaches for help</strong> - I hardly ever ask for
            help, but I know asking could save me time and give me new
            perspectives.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reflection</strong> - Writing things like this shows me
            what's working and what I need to improve.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Reluctant to Ask for Help</h2>
        <p>
          Honestly, I don't really ask for help much with everything. I've got
          this stubborn streak where I want to sort things out on my own, even
          if it takes longer.
        </p>
        <p>
          It works sometimes, but I know I could save time (and stress) if I
          asked sooner. That's something I want to get better at but still
          keeping my independence and not wasting hours stuck on little things.
