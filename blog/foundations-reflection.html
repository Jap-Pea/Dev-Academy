        <h2>Three things I learnt about myself & ego</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            My ego makes me stubborn sometimes. I'll grind solo too long instead
            of asking for help.
          </li>
          <li>
            I get frustrated when I don't pick things up fast, that's just ego
            wanting instant results.
          </li>
          <li>
            When I check my ego, I enjoy learning more because I focus on
            progress, not perfection.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Role of values, empathy, and self-awareness</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Values</strong> reminds me how I want to show up. When I'm
            debugging, that means sticking it out instead of giving up. When Im
            stuck, it means being straight up about it instead of pretending Ive
            got it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Empathy</strong> is about stepping into someone else's
            shoes, whether it's the user trying to click through my site, or a
            teammate explaining their idea. It smooths out the bumps when we're
            working together.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Self-awareness</strong> is important. Knowing when I'm
            stuck, when I'm tired, or when I need to try a different approach
            stops me from spiralling.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What surprised me</h2>
        <p>
          I thought Human Skills were a bit "extra", but they directly affect
          how fast I learn, how I debug, and how to work and communicate in
          group projects.

        <h2>Most challenging parts</h2>
        <p>
          Reflection. Slowing down to look at my process felt awkward at first,
          but I could see how much I learnt just by stopping and looking back at
          my process.

        <h2>Why a dev bootcamp teaches Human Skills</h2>
        <p>
          Real dev work is teamwork, feedback, stress management, and
          communication on top of code. Human Skills make you employable and
          make teams effective.

        <h2>Was this a waste of time?</h2>
        <p>
          Nah. More coding alone isn't the answer. These skills give me tools to
          stay calm, to work with others, and to actually enjoy the journey. So
          in the long run, this time will save me from wasting way more time
          later.
