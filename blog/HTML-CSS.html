      <h1>Positioning in CSS — Relative, Absolute, and Fixed Explained</h1>

      <p>
        When I first started learning how websites are built, positioning
        elements on the screen felt a bit like trying to park a car in the dark.
        I'd write some code, reload the page… and boom! My button is halfway
        across the screen and my image's on a milk run.
      </p>

      <p>
        CSS gives us some powerful tools to
        <strong>control exactly where things sit</strong> on the page. You just
        need to understand how they work.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let me walk you through three of the most common types of positioning in
        CSS:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>relative</code></li>
        <li><code>absolute</code></li>
        <li><code>fixed</code></li>
      </ul>

      <h2><code>relative</code> - “You moved me, but that's still my spot”</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Relative</strong> positioning is like saying:<br /><em
          >"Hey, I'm normally here… but I'll shift over a bit. Just know I'm
          still technically in the original spot."</em
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        It <strong>starts from the element's original position</strong> and
        nudges it using <code>top</code>, <code>left</code>, <code>right</code>,
        or <code>bottom</code>.
      </p>

      <pre><code>.box {
  position: relative;
  top: 20px;
  left: 30px;
}</code></pre>

      <p>
        That moves the box down 20px and to the right 30px — but it still leaves
        a “ghost” behind where it started.
      </p>

      <h2>
        <code>absolute</code> - “Tell me who to stick to, and I'll go there”
      </h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Absolute</strong> positioning is like saying:
        <em
          >“Forget where I came from — I go wherever my closest positioned
          parent tells me… and if no one claims me, I stick to the page
          itself.”</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        When something's positioned absolutely, it's taken out of the normal
        flow, like it vanished from the room. Everything else acts like it's not
        even there, and it finds the closest 'boss' with instructions and
        follows them. No boss? It reports to the whole page. If no positioned
        parent is found, it sticks to the page itself
        <em
          >(like the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>)</em
        >.
      </p>

      <pre><code>.container {
  position: relative;
}

.box {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
}</code></pre>

      <p>
        That will put the box to the top-right of its container (or the whole
        page if no parent is positioned).
      </p>

      <h2><code>fixed</code> - “I'll stay here no matter where you scroll”</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Fixed</strong> positioning is like saying:
        <em
          >"I'm glued to this spot on the screen, no matter how much you
          scroll."</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        It sticks to the screen. Even if you scroll, it stays locked in place.
      </p>

      <pre><code>.navbar {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
}</code></pre>

      <p>
        This pins the navbar to the top of the screen, like a sticky header or a
        floating chat window.
      </p>

      <h2>Quick Recap</h2>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Position Type</th>
            <th>Keeps it's Place?</th>
            <th>Moves From</th>
            <th>Sticks To</th>
            <th>Scrolls with Page?</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><code>relative</code></td>
            <td>✅ Yes</td>
            <td>Its normal spot</td>
            <td>Itself</td>
            <td>✅ Yes</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>absolute</code></td>
            <td>❌ No</td>
            <td>Closest positioned parent</td>
            <td>That parent</td>
            <td>✅ Yes</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>fixed</code></td>
            <td>❌ No</td>
            <td>Viewport</td>
            <td>The screen</td>
            <td>❌ No</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h2>Try it Yourself</h2>
      <p>Here's a small snippet you can copy into your own project:</p>

      <pre><code>&lt;div class="container"&gt;
  &lt;div class="box"&gt;I'm positioned!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

      <p>
        Then play with different <code>position</code> types in CSS and see what
        happens!
      </p>

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        CSS positioning used to feel like a fight. Now it's more like giving
        directions — once you know the rules, things go where you want, no
        stress.
      </p>

      <p>Hope this has helped!</p>
