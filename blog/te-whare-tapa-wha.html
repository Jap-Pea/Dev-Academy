        Dev Academy has a commitment to Te Tiriti O Waitangi and is working out
        how to honour and integrate its principles. We all live in Aotearoa and
        drawing on a wellbeing model grounded in Te Ao Māori makes sense. We
        teach the whole person at Dev Academy, and this holistic approach is
        aligned with that.

        <h2>What is Te Whare Tapa Whā?</h2>
        <p>
          Te Whare Tapa Whā is a model of wellbeing built around four walls of a
          wharenui (meeting house) — taha tinana (physical), taha hinengaro
          (mental & emotional), taha wairua (spiritual), and taha whānau (family
          & social). All four are supported by whenua (the land, our
          foundations). If one wall is weak, the whole house is affected — same
          as our wellbeing.

          <li>Listen to music/audiobooks that grounds me</li>
          <li>Spend time reflecting on values and purpose, not just tasks</li>
        </ul>

          <li>Go for walks outside, even short ones during breaks</li>
          <li>
            Touch base with nature — <strong>barefoot</strong> on the grass,
            trips to the beach
          </li>
          <li>Remember my connection to Aotearoa and where I come from</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          This model is a good reminder that studying isn't just about grinding
          code — I need to look after my whole self. If one wall is off, it
          affects the rest. By keeping these practices in balance, I'll have a
          stronger foundation for learning and for life.
