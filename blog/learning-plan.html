      <h2>Long-Term Goal / Career Pathway</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>My long-term goal</strong> is to become a full-stack developer
        and eventually break into game development. I want a career where I can
        build cool, useful or fun digital experiences, ideally something
        creative, like games or interactive tools. I also want to set myself up
        to work remotely or even freelance so I can spend more time with my
        whānau, while doing something I enjoy.
      </p>

      <h2>Strengths & Limitations as a Learner</h2>
      <p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>I learn best by working hands-on</strong>. Real world examples
          stick with me more than theory alone.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>I am curious</strong> and <strong>motivated</strong>. If
          something interests me, I'll chase it down until I figure it out.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>I've already started building</strong> things like websites,
          scripts, little games and I've been teaching myself for a while.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>I like challenges</strong> and I enjoy breaking problems down
          to find solutions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>If I don't understand</strong> something, I'm not afraid to
          ask questions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>I don't care</strong> what people think of me,
          <strong>respectfully</strong>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Limitations:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>I sometimes doubt myself</strong> or
          <strong>overthink</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>I can get overwhelmed</strong> if too many tasks stack up
          without structure.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>I tend to work independently</strong>, so I'm still getting
          used to working and sharing openly in a group setting.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>I'm juggling learning</strong> with being a father. Time
          management will be key for me.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>I don't think I'm a good communicator</strong>. I struggle to
          explain things or can't find the right words. (It's like my brain is
          firing faster than I can speak).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Time delegation</strong> and <strong>distraction</strong> when
          working on my personal projects.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <hr />

      <h2>Non-Technical / Human Skills I Want to Develop</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Clear and confident communication</strong>, especially when
          explaining my thinking or giving feedback.
        </li>
        <li><strong>How to ask</strong> the right questions.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Working effectively</strong> in a team. Listening,
          collaborating, and sharing ideas.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Time management</strong> and learning how to plan smarter, not
          just harder.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Staying calm</strong> and <strong>focused</strong> when things
          don't go to plan.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <hr />

      <h2>Workload & Time Management Commitments</h2>
      <p><strong>How I'll Work Productively and Safely:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>I'll treat Dev Academy like a job</strong>, show up, be
          present, and do the mahi.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>I'll respect the space</strong>, the kaupapa, and everyone's
          time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>I'll make an effort to communicate</strong> clearly and
          support others where I can.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Using Toggl</strong> to track my time.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>When Things Get Tough:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>I'll take a break</strong>, go outside, reset instead of
          powering through blindly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>I'll talk to the team</strong> instead of isolating myself.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>I'll check in with myself</strong> and my schedule, then
          reprioritise tasks to lighten the mental load.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>How and When I'll Seek Help:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>If I'm stuck</strong> for more than 20-30 mins and have
          already tried a few things, I'll reach out and ask a facilitator or
          another team member.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>I'll be specific</strong> when asking for help. Show what I've
          tried and where I'm blocked.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>I won't be afraid</strong> to speak up, even if it feels
          awkward. We're all here to learn.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <hr />

      <h2>What I Expect From the Facilitation Team</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Honest, clear feedback</strong>, not just what I did wrong,
          but how I can grow from it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Support if I'm stuck</strong>, not just give me the answers,
          but help guide me back on track.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Respect and understanding</strong> that I'm balancing a lot
          outside the course too.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <hr />

      <h2>My Scheduling / Block-Out Times</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I'm a father and work full time driving a truck, so I'm very
          <em>strict</em>
          with not being on my phone. Every work day is different so it's hard
          to know when I'll be stopped to be able to check my phone.
        </li>
        <li><strong>My best focused hours are:</strong></li>
        <ul>
          <li>7-10:30pm weekdays. Can be off and on from 5pm</li>
          <li>
            Thursdays I finish early to pick the kids up, so I'm on and off from
            3.30pm onwards. Full time 7pm onwards
          </li>
          <li>I can check in most evenings after 7pm if needed</li>
          <li>Samoa trip: Sept 29 - Oct 7</li>
          <li>Maybe away over Xmas/New Years (not confirmed)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          If anything unexpected comes up (family emergency, sick kids, etc),
          I'll communicate ASAP and work around it professionally.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <hr />

      <h2>Final Words</h2>
      <p>
        I'm fully in. I want to grow, learn, and challenge myself, not just to
        “pass” this bootcamp, but to walk away a better version of myself, with
        skills I can be proud of. I'll commit to showing up, being real, and
        giving it my all.

        <h2>Long Term Goal / Career Pathway</h2>
        <p>
          Long term, I want to build a career in game development and creative
          tech. Freelance. I see myself involed in creating games, whether it be
          browser games, or bigger projects in Unreal Engine. I'd also like to
          build my own brand — IndaiGo — into something solid, whether that's a
          studio, a hub for games, or a space for creative projects. I want this
          pathway to give me freedom and stability for my whānau.

      <section>
        <h2>Using Skills Beyond Dev Academy</h2>
        <p>
          I want to use these skills to get my first role in the tech industry,
          ideally in game development or something close to it. Even if I start
          in web or software, I see it as stepping stones to games. I'd like to
          bring a unique perspective into whatever team I join. With my
          creativity, eagerness, and the discipline I've built from life, work
          and self learning. I want to prove to myself that I can take all the
          different skills and interests I've built up and turn them into a
          solid career path in tech.

        <h2>Strengths and Limitations in Bootcamp</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Strengths:</strong> Determination, creativity, self teaching
            attitude.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Limitations:</strong> I can hold back asking for help,
            holding back in groups. Time management juggling family and work.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <hr />

      <section>
        <h2>Re-evaluating Strengths and Limitations</h2>
        <p>
          From Sprint 2, I said I was reluctant to ask for help. That hasn't
          magically gone away, but now I'm more aware of it. Reflection has
          helped me see that asking earlier saves time, and that ego gets in the
          way. A new strength I've noticed is that I actually enjoy reflecting
          and breaking things into steps. That'll help me when Bootcamp gets
          hectic. A limitation I've noticed is overloading myself, I'll try to
          learn everything at once, which can burn me out.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Biggest Non-Technical Challenge</h2>
        <p>
          Probably balancing focus and energy across the weeks. It's a long
          sprint, not a quick one. Staying engaged in group work when I'm tired
          or stressed will be a challenge too.
        </p>
      </section>
      <hr />

      <section>
        <h2>Human Skills I Want to Develop</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Asking for help sooner without overthinking.</li>
          <li>Being more confident sharing ideas in group settings.</li>
          <li>Practicing giving and receiving feedback in a useful way.</li>
          <li>Keeping my focus sharp over long stretches.</li>

        <h2>Expectations from the Bootcamp Team</h2>
        <p>
          I don't expect the team to spoon feed me answers, but I'd like clear
          guidance when I'm stuck, and honesty if I'm going off track. Support
          to me looks like check ins, encouragement, and being approachable so I
          don't feel dumb asking questions.
        </p>
      </section>
      <hr />

      <section>
        <h2>Expectations of Myself</h2>
        <p>
          To give my full energy, to manage my time better, and to lean into the
          uncomfortable stuff, like group work, pair programming, and
          reflection. I expect myself to show up consistently, even when I'm
          tired or stressed.
        </p>
      </section>
      <hr />

      <section>
        <h2>Seeking Help in a Timely Way</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Reread error messages and try console.logging to break the problem
            down.
          </li>
          <li>Google it or check docs.</li>
          <li>Ask peers, sometimes just talking it out solves it.</li>
          <li>Go to facilitator without waiting too long.</li>
        </ol>
      </section>
      <hr />

      <section>
        <h2>Commitment to Managing Workload</h2>
        <p>
          I commit to pacing myself. That means not pulling unhealthy all
          nighters, but instead working smart, planning my day, taking breaks,
          and keeping balance with family life. I'll make sure I contribute
          fairly in groups, respect others, and keep communication honest. My
          aim is to finish Bootcamp in a way that's productive, safe, and
          sustainable, so I leave with skills, confidence, and energy for the
          future.
