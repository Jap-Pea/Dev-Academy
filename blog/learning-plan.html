      <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>
      <a href="../index.html">Back to Home</a>

      <h2>Long-Term Goal / Career Pathway</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>My long-term goal</strong> is to become a full-stack developer
        and eventually break into game development. I want a career where I can
        build cool, useful or fun digital experiences, ideally something
        creative, like games or interactive tools. I also want to set myself up
        to work remotely or even freelance so I can spend more time with my
        whānau, while doing something I enjoy.
      </p>

      <h2>Strengths & Limitations as a Learner</h2>
      <p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>I learn best by working hands-on</strong>. Real world examples
          stick with me more than theory alone.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>I am curious</strong> and <strong>motivated</strong>. If
          something interests me, I'll chase it down until I figure it out.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>I've already started building</strong> things like websites,
          scripts, little games and I've been teaching myself for a while.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>I like challenges</strong> and I enjoy breaking problems down
          to find solutions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>If I don't understand</strong> something, I'm not afraid to
          ask questions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>I don't care</strong> what people think of me,
          <strong>respectfully</strong>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Limitations:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>I sometimes doubt myself</strong> or
          <strong>overthink</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>I can get overwhelmed</strong> if too many tasks stack up
          without structure.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>I tend to work independently</strong>, so I'm still getting
          used to working and sharing openly in a group setting.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>I'm juggling learning</strong> with being a father. Time
          management will be key for me.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>I don't think I'm a good communicator</strong>. I struggle to
          explain things or can't find the right words. (It's like my brain is
          firing faster than I can speak).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Time delegation</strong> and <strong>distraction</strong> when
          working on my personal projects.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Non-Technical / Human Skills I Want to Develop</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Clear and confident communication</strong>, especially when
          explaining my thinking or giving feedback.
        </li>
        <li><strong>How to ask</strong> the right questions.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Working effectively</strong> in a team. Listening,
          collaborating, and sharing ideas.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Time management</strong> and learning how to plan smarter, not
          just harder.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Staying calm</strong> and <strong>focused</strong> when things
          don't go to plan.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Workload & Time Management Commitments</h2>
      <p><strong>How I'll Work Productively and Safely:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>I'll treat Dev Academy like a job</strong>, show up, be
          present, and do the mahi.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>I'll respect the space</strong>, the kaupapa, and everyone's
          time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>I'll make an effort to communicate</strong> clearly and
          support others where I can.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Using Toggl</strong> to track my time.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>When Things Get Tough:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>I'll take a break</strong>, go outside, reset instead of
          powering through blindly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>I'll talk to the team</strong> instead of isolating myself.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>I'll check in with myself</strong> and my schedule, then
          reprioritise tasks to lighten the mental load.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>How and When I'll Seek Help:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>If I'm stuck</strong> for more than 20-30 mins and have
          already tried a few things, I'll reach out and ask a facilitator or
          another team member.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>I'll be specific</strong> when asking for help. Show what I've
          tried and where I'm blocked.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>I won't be afraid</strong> to speak up, even if it feels
          awkward. We're all here to learn.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What I Expect From the Facilitation Team</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Honest, clear feedback</strong>, not just what I did wrong,
          but how I can grow from it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Support if I'm stuck</strong>, not just give me the answers,
          but help guide me back on track.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Respect and understanding</strong> that I'm balancing a lot
          outside the course too.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>My Scheduling / Block-Out Times</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I'm a father and work full time driving a truck, so I'm very
          <em>strict</em>
          with not being on my phone. Every work day is different so it's hard
          to know when I'll be stopped to be able to check my phone.
        </li>
        <li><strong>My best focused hours are:</strong></li>
        <ul>
          <li>7-10:30pm weekdays. Can be off and on from 5pm</li>
          <li>
            Thursdays I finish early to pick the kids up, so I'm on and off from
            3.30pm onwards. Full time 7pm onwards
          </li>
          <li>I can check in most evenings after 7pm if needed</li>
          <li>Samoa trip: Sept 29 - Oct 7</li>
          <li>Maybe away over Xmas/New Years (not confirmed)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          If anything unexpected comes up (family emergency, sick kids, etc),
          I'll communicate ASAP and work around it professionally.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Final Words</h2>
      <p>
        I'm fully in. I want to grow, learn, and challenge myself, not just to
        “pass” this bootcamp, but to walk away a better version of myself, with
        skills I can be proud of. I'll commit to showing up, being real, and
        giving it my all.
