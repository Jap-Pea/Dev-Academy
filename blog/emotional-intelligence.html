      <p>
        Emotional Intelligence (EQ) is basically your ability to understand and
        manage emotions, not just your own, but other people's too. It's more
        than just knowing how you feel. It's about using that awareness to make
        better choices, handle tricky situations, and keep your relationships
        healthy. Things like..
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Self-awareness</strong>- Knowing what you're feeling and how
          it impacts your thoughts and actions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Self-control</strong>- Keeping your emotions in check,
          especially when things get stressful.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Motivation</strong>- Staying driven and focused, even when
          challenges pop up.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Empathy</strong>- Being able to see things from someone else's
          perspective.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Social skills</strong>- Communicating well, building trust,
          being someone people can come to.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>How is EQ Different from IQ?</h2>
      <p>
        IQ (Intelligence Quotient) is all about brainpower, problem-solving,
        reasoning, learning, and memory.<br />EQ is about people skills and
        emotional awareness.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>IQ</strong> helps you figure things out logically and learn
          new information.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>EQ</strong> helps you handle your feelings, read the room, and
          connect with people.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        While both matter, studies show that EQ often has a bigger impact on
        long-term success, because most of life's daily challenges involve
        dealing with people.
      </p>
      <h2>Why is EQ Important?</h2>
      <ol>

          build trust, and communicate better.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Smarter decisions</strong>- Having a better EQ means you can
          separate feelings from facts and think clearly.
